# Role of Love

## What does Jesus connect to the keeping of His commandments?

"If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15).

## What comes first: love or obedience?

"And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. [4] He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. [5] But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. [6] He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked" (1 John 2:3-6).

Note: Obedience is the evidence of my love for God.

"The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people: [8] But because the LORD loved you ...  [11] Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them" (Deuteronomy 7:7,8,11).

Note: The exodus can be seen as an allegory of the Christian walk.

## How does my love for Christ result in obedience?

"Ye that love the LORD, hate evil" (Psalm 97:10).

"The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee" (Jeremiah 31:3).

"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. ... [3] I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; ...  [4] I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love" (Hosea 11:1-4).

Note: God seeks to draw us into a life of obedience through His expression of love towards us.

## How do I receive this love?

"But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord"  (2 Corinthians 3:18).

"We love him, because he first loved us" (1 John 4:19).

"Those who make room in their hearts for Jesus will realize His love. ... The Holy Spirit never leaves unassisted the soul who is looking unto Jesus. ... If the eye is kept fixed on Christ, the work of the Spirit ceases not until the soul is conformed to His image" (*Desire of Ages* 302.1).

"It is by beholding His [Christ's] love, by dwelling upon it, by drinking it in, that we are to become partakers of His nature. ... A theoretical knowledge will do us no good. We must feed upon Him, receive Him into the heart, so that His life becomes our life. His love, His grace, must be assimilated" (*Desire of Ages* 389.3).

## Where is Christ's love for us most clearly seen?

"Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins" (1 John 4:10).

"Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. [48] And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven" (Luke 7:47,48).

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. [17] For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved" (John 3:16,17).

## What relationship does love for Christ have to salvation?

"Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name" (Psalms 91:14).
