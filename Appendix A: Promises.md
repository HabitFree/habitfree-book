## Protection from Temptation

"The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them" (Psalm 34:7).

"Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is 
overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I. For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the 
enemy" (Psalm 61:1â€“3).
